# Elearning_Website
In today's world, acquiring new skills has become an absolute necessity. There are many online learning platforms where one can learn various subject. Infact every learning has become an online learning now. Keeping this in mind, I have developed an e-learning website that offers courses in the domains of foreign languages, enginnering and computer sciences. There are 36 courses in total and a payment gateway has also been developed.

Type "localhost/phpmyadmin/" in your browser and create a new database "register". There is an import option in this database. Import the "users.sql" file. You will se a table "users".
